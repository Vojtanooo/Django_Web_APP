# Counting hours app
So i want to create aplication for counting my working hours. First of all i make basic aplication in python. Then i start thinking about i need this aplication everywhere im. Make some resource and i find Django framework. And jurney begin.. i read documentation about django then watch some youtube tutorial and start writing my program. After some months :D i wrote my first web aplication. After all of that deploy this project on pythonanywhere.com was really easy. Now i have my applicatin live on server. http://bulays.pythonanywhere.com/
